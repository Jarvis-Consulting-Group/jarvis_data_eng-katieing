# Katie Ing . Jarvis Consulting

I am an aspiring Business Systems Analyst with a recent master's degree in mathematics from the University of Toronto. I am drawn to a BSA role because it allows me to merge my exceptional problem-solving skills, developed through my academic background, with my ability to collaborate effectively within teams. With teaching assistant positions, I have developed exceptional communication skills, while research assistant roles have provided experience in data analysis on Microsoft Excel. Currently working as a technical consultant at Jarvis, I have gained proficiency in PostgreSQL. As I pursue a BSA role, problem-solving, teamwork, communication, and technical expertise, making me an ideal candidate.
