# Katie Ing . Jarvis Consulting

I am an aspiring Business Systems Analyst with a recent master's degree in mathematics from the University of Toronto. I am drawn to a BSA role because it allows me to merge my exceptional problem-solving skills, developed through my academic background, with my ability to collaborate effectively within teams. With teaching assistant positions, I have developed exceptional communication skills, while research assistant roles have provided experience in data analysis, data gathering and reporting. Currently working as a technical consultant at Jarvis, I have gained proficiency in PostgreSQL. Additionally, I have gained strong relationship development skills through a variety of academic and seasonal positions.

**Linux Cluster Resource Monitoring App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng-katieing/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed a monitoring agent that collects and records hardware and memory usage data, to provide valuable insights to business owners and team leads for future planning. This tool empowers stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding resource allocation and optimization. The data is stored and queried on a PostgreSQL database for scalable management. This project is meticulously documented to ensure straightforward setup for current and future clients.

**SQL Project** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng-katieing/tree/master/sql)]: Established a comprehensive database for a newly established country club using PostgreSQL. The goal of the database is to be utilized by country club managers to analyze facility usage and demand. Demonstrated usage by executing sample queries and verifying accuracy with test data.

**BSA Crash Course** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng-katieing/tree/master/)]: Authored a comprehensive Business Requirements Document (BRD) for a Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent project, thoroughly detailing the project scope, business requirements, timeline, and cost-benefit analysis. Orchestrated an elicitation meeting with stakeholders and crafted a concise System Requirements Document (SRD) for a Retail Stock Trading Application. Effectively translated business needs into technical specifications by creating architecture and ER diagrams, and communicating complete use cases and data requirements.

**JDBC App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng-katieing/tree/master/core_java/jdbc)]: Developed a JDBC application that interfaces with a PostgreSQL database, enabling CRUD operations for a database within a retail context. Leveraged Java to connect to a sales database, offering functionalities like customer data manipulation and retrieval, as well as order and order item data retrieval. Employed Maven for efficient build management.
