      Leveraged Java to connect to a sales database, offering functionalities like customer data manipulation and retrieval, 
      as well as order and order item data retrieval. Verified expected behaviour through manual testing of a sample database. 
      Employed Maven for efficient build management."
      - "Grep App: Designed an application to recursively search a directory for lines of text that match a 
      Regex search pattern and write the matching lines to a file. 
      Developed the app using core Java, and harnessed Regex and Stream APIs for efficient processing of large directories and files. 
      Manually tested the app with thorough example use cases and expected user errors. 
      Managed dependencies and build process through Maven, and containerized with Docker. After deployment, 
      added a feature to handle read-access exceptions and increase reporting. "
